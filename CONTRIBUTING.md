# Contributing to RUNE

Thanks for contributing.

## Start here

1. read `README.md` for usage and scope
2. read `docs/architecture.md` for canonical semantics and invariants
3. keep changes minimal, explicit, and reviewable

By participating in this project you agree to abide by the
[Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Developer Certificate of Origin

All code contributions must be made with Developer Certificate of
Origin (DCO) sign-off. Add a `Signed-off-by` trailer to every commit:

```text
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
```

The usual Git command is:

```bash
git commit -s
```

By signing off, you assert that you have the right to submit the
contribution under the project license. Pull requests with unsigned
commits are not accepted.

## Project-specific expectations

These rules are critical and must be preserved:

- preserve mode parity:
  - the GUI wizard, the interactive CLI, and non-interactive runs must
    share identical engine semantics
- keep the engine boundary strict:
  - no execution, interpolation, or condition logic in frontend code
- never write unmasked secret values to logs, result files, or console output
- commands are executed as argv arrays, never through an implicit shell
- add or update tests when behavior changes
- update documentation when user-visible behavior or guarantees change

## Development workflow

### Branching strategy

- `main` should remain integration-ready and green
- no direct commits to `main`
- keep each pull request focused on one concern
- avoid mixing refactors and behavior changes unless the coupling is real and
  unavoidable

### Branch naming

Use the following pattern:

```text
<type>/<short-description>
```

Examples:

```text
feat/directory-input-validation
fix/exit-code-mapping
refactor/step-planner
docs/readme-operating-modes
test/non-interactive-run
chore/repo-bootstrap
```

### Working process

1. create a branch from `main`
2. implement your change
3. write clean commits
4. ensure tests pass
5. open a pull request

## Commit message policy

This project uses Conventional Commits.

### Format

```text
<type>(<scope>): <summary>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

### Header rules

- use imperative mood, for example `add`, not `added`
- do not end the header with a period
- maximum 72 characters
- keep it concise and descriptive
- scope is recommended but optional

Examples:

```text
feat(engine): add step timeout handling
fix(runner): prevent secret values in process logs
refactor(config): split schema loading and validation
docs(readme): clarify operating modes
```

### Allowed types

```text
feat      new functionality
fix       bug fix
refactor  internal restructuring without behavior change
docs      documentation changes
test      tests
build     build system or dependencies
ci        CI/CD changes
perf      performance improvements
chore     maintenance tasks
revert    revert previous commit
```

### Commit body guidelines

The commit body should explain context, not repeat the diff.

It should answer:

- why was this change necessary?
- what was changed conceptually?

Recommended structure:

```text
Why:
- describe the problem or motivation

What:
- describe the key changes
- mention important design decisions
```

### When a body is required

A commit body is required for:

- `feat`
- `fix`
- `refactor`
- any change affecting behavior, API, lifecycle, or semantics

A commit body is optional for:

- `docs`
- small `test` changes
- trivial `chore` or `ci` updates

### Readability

- header: max 72 characters
- body: keep paragraphs readable in GitHub and terminal tools; avoid
  very long lines, but wrap where it improves clarity rather than to
  satisfy a fixed column count

### Footer

Use footers for metadata when relevant:

```text
BREAKING CHANGE: description
Refs: #123
Closes: #123
```

## Pull requests

### General rules

- pull requests must be focused on a single concern
- avoid mixing refactoring and behavior changes
- prefer small to medium-sized pull requests
- ensure the change is reviewable

### PR title

PR titles should follow Conventional Commits:

```text
<type>(<scope>): <summary>
```

### PR expectations

Before opening a PR:

- tests pass
- documentation is updated if needed
- changes are cleanly structured

A good PR should clearly explain:

- what was changed
- why it was changed
- any important side effects or constraints

### Labels

Issues and pull requests use scoped labels to describe different review
questions:

- use exactly one `type:*` label for the intended change kind, matching the
  Conventional Commit type when possible
- use zero or more `area:*` labels for the affected subsystem or project
  surface
- use `severity:*` labels for defects, findings, security work, or other
  risk-bearing changes where priority matters

`type:*` and `area:*` labels may intentionally overlap. For example, a CI
workflow change can use both `type:ci` (the change kind) and `area:ci` (the
affected project area).

## Testing

- add tests for new behavior
- add regression tests for bug fixes
- ensure the relevant test slice passes before opening a pull request
- run the full gate before opening a pull request — exactly what CI runs:
  `npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm run format:check && npm run depcruise && npm test`
  (`npm run format` fixes formatting)
- unit tests live in `packages/<pkg>/test/` (vitest), cross-package suites in `tests/`;
  `packages/gui-shell/tests/` is reserved for the Playwright smoke suite

## Documentation

Documentation must be updated when:

- behavior changes
- APIs change
- guarantees or invariants change

## Versioning

This project follows Semantic Versioning:

- `fix` -> patch
- `feat` -> minor
- breaking changes -> major

## Final notes

- prefer clarity over cleverness
- prefer explicit design over implicit behavior
- prefer behaviorally strong tests over incidental implementation checks

Consistency in history and structure is critical for long-term
maintainability.
